# Solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Using Genetic Algorithm
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city? **[1]** To solving this problem, I tried to implementation genetic algorithm in Python.

### Result in 100 generation for 14 cities
