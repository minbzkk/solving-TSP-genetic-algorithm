# Solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) Using Genetic Algorithm
I tried to implementation genetic algorithm in Python for solving the travelling salesman problem.

## Description
First of all, the travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city? **[1]** Solving this problem, I implementation genetic algorithm in Python.
